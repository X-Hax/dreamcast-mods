Level IDs that are different from the final version:
34 Twinkle Circuit (Y0B)
35 Sky Chase Act 1 (Z0B)
35 Sky Chase Act 2 (Z0B - looks like it loads the one for Act 1 even if the one for Act 2 exists)
36 Sand Hill (1A0B)
37 SS garden (1B0B)
38 EC garden (1C0B)
39 MR garden (1D0B)
40 Chao Race (1E0B)

Notes on Station Square:
-Act 0/City Hall area loads Q0B (doesn't exist in final/AD) but having that file overrides lighting in other acts
-Act 1/Casino area loads Q1B (evening in final and AD)
-Act 2/Sewers area loads Q2B (doesn't exist in final/AD)
-Act 3/Station area loads Q3B (night in final, doesn't exist in AD)
-Act 4/Hotel area loads Q4B (day in final and AD)
-Act 5/Twinkle Park area loads Q5B (doesn't exist in final and AD)
In this mod, Q0B is not restored, Q2B is day, Q3B is night and Q5B is day.
